<p><h3>About gerbils</h3></p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>In burrows deep, where shadows play,<br>
    Tiny whiskered creatures, in fur array.<br>
    Gerbils, a dance of nature's grace,<br>
    A world in miniature, a bustling place.</p>

    <p>With fur of silk, a sandy hue,<br>
    They scurry and scamper, a joy to view.<br>
    Eyes like beads, so bright and keen,<br>
    In their world, a kingdom unseen.</p>

    <p>Cheeks that pouch a secret stash,<br>
    Gnawing teeth that never clash.<br>
    A ballet of tails in rhythmic delight,<br>
    Gerbils dance through the soft moonlight.</p>

    <p>In tunnels woven, a labyrinth spun,<br>
    A web of life, their haven won.<br>
    Tiny architects, builders so sly,<br>
    Crafting homes 'neath the open sky.</p>

    <p>Oh, gerbils, guardians of the earth,<br>
    In your realm, we find rebirth.<br>
    A lesson learned in the smallest of paws,<br>
    Nature's poetry, without a pause.</p>

    <p>Gentle souls with hearts so pure,<br>
    In their eyes, an innocence to endure.<br>
    Gerbils, a symphony of whiskers and fur,<br>
    A testament to life's soft, rhythmic blur.</p>
